## FAQ

1. Why is there only 1 profile available to use?

   > Go back to the main menu and click on "Profile: " at the top right of the screen. Create a new profile and try again.

2. Does the mod support multiple keyboards and mice?

   > No. This is a limitation in Risk of Rain 2 and therefore will never be supported. Use [Nucleus](https://nucleus-coop.github.io/) instead.
   
3. How do I disable multi-monitor mode?

   > Disabling activated displays in Unity is impossible. This means that to disable multi-monitor mode you must restart the game.
